# Class_History

The Repo is a description of the Comp Sci classes I have taken throughout my time in University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, as well as the code for a Robotics project.

CSCI 3081 - Program Design and Development

Principles of programming design/analysis. Concepts in software development. Uses C/C++ language to illustrate key ideas in program design/development, data structures, debugging, files, I/O, state machines, testing, coding standards.

CSCI 4041 - Algorithms and Data Structures

 Rigorous analysis of algorithms/implementation. Algorithm analysis, sorting algorithms, binary trees, heaps, priority queues, heapsort, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, graphs, graph traversal, single source shortest path, minimum cost spanning trees, binary search trees, hash tables and hashing. 
 
 CSCI 4131 - Internet Programming
 
 Issues in internet programming. Internet history, architecture/protocols, network programming, Web architecture. Client-server architectures and protocols. Client-side programming, server-side programming, dynamic HTML, Java programming, object-oriented architecture/design, distributed object computing, Web applications.
 
 CSCI 4511 - Intro to AI
 
A brief overview, agent definition search (search space, uninformed and informed search, game playing, constraint satisfaction), planning, knowledge representation (logical encodings of domain knowledge, ontologies). 

CSCI 4611 - Programming Games and Graphics

Tools/techniques for programming games/interactive computer graphics. Event loops, rendering/animation, polygonal models, texturing, physical simulation. Modern graphics toolkits. History/future of computer games technology. Social impact of interactive computer graphics.

CSCI 5512 - Artificial Intelligence II

This course covers Artificial Intelligence (AI) that deals with uncertainty or learning. It covers: a brief review of uncertainty and probability, Bayesian networks, Markov models, decision trees/networks, neural networks and reinforcement learning. 

CSCI 5523 - Intro to Data Mining

Data pre-processing techniques, data types, similarity measures, data visualization/exploration. Predictive models (e.g., decision trees, SVM, Bayes, K-nearest neighbors, bagging, boosting). Model evaluation techniques, Clustering (hierarchical, partitional, density-based), association analysis, anomaly detection. Case studies from areas such as earth science, the Web, network intrusion, and genomics. Hands-on projects.

CSCI 5551 - Robotics

Transformations, kinematics/inverse kinematics, dynamics, control. Sensing (robot vision, force control, tactile sensing), applications of sensor-based robot control, robot programming, mobile robotics, microrobotics.

Robotics end of the year we selected to solve a tower of hanoi with a robot, project in repo, under ros_ws2
